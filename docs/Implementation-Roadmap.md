# **FEM Protocol Implementation Roadmap**

**Core Philosophy:** The FEM Protocol enables **Secure Hosted Embodiment**, a new paradigm where a guest "mind" can inhabit a "body" offered within a host's "environment." This moves beyond simple tool federation to a model of **Secure Delegated Control**, allowing for rich applications like collaborative virtual presence and co-operative application control.

## **Phase 1: The Ubiquitous Agent - SDKs & Usability**

*(**Goal:** Make building and embodying a FEM Protocol agent an effortless and powerful experience for any developer on any platform.)*

* **1A. Official Client SDKs (Go, Python, TypeScript):**  
  * **Action:** Create standalone, idiomatic SDKs. This remains the **highest priority** for driving adoption.  
  * **Deliverable:** A developer can pip install fem-sdk or npm install femp and interact with the network in under 10 lines of code.  
* **1B. Launch a Registry for "Body Templates":**  
  * **Action:** Frame the "Body Library" concept as a registry for discoverable BodyDefinition templates. This is key for the "guesting" model.  
  * **Deliverable:** A mechanism for a host to define and securely offer a BodyDefinition to external agents.  
* **1C. Solidify the Invocation Path (Broker as Secure Proxy):**  
  * **Action:** Formally commit to the **Broker as Proxy** model. For a host to securely allow a guest agent to control parts of its environment, all tool calls *must* be proxied through the host's broker.  
  * **Deliverable:** The broker's toolCall handler is fully implemented as a secure proxy. All SDKs will use this as the exclusive method for tool invocation, ensuring the host retains control.

## **Phase 2: The Sentient Network - The Broker-as-Agent**

*(**Goal:** Refactor the Broker into a first-class agent, establishing a consistent and powerful model for network management and hosted embodiment.)*

* **2A. Define the Broker's "Mind":**  
  * **Action:** Formalize the broker's core logic. The FederationManager, HealthChecker, and LoadBalancer are internal components of its "mind."  
  * **Deliverable:** The broker has its own Ed25519 identity, signs all cross-broker communication, and operates based on a configurable policy engine.  
* **2B. Implement the Broker's "Body" (Network & Embodiment Tools):**  
  * **Action:** Implement a suite of network-level capabilities exposed as an internal MCP tool suite. This makes network management a first-class, secure part of the protocol.  
  * **Deliverable:** A documented set of tools for admin agents, with a new, critical tool:  
    * security.grant\_embodiment(guest\_agent\_id, body\_definition\_id, duration): Explicitly grants a guest "mind" permission to inhabit a specific "body."  
    * federation.connect(broker\_url)  
    * security.revoke\_agent(agent\_id)  
* **2C. Implement Broker Embodiment:**  
  * **Action:** Enable the broker to embody different "bodies" based on its environment.  
  * **Deliverable:** Production vs. Development embodiments with different toolsets and security policies.  
* **2D. Build the fem-admin Host Dashboard:**  
  * **Action:** Create a web-based "Environment Host" dashboard.  
  * **Deliverable:** A live, interactive web application built in my canvas. It will use the broker's new API to manage guest sessions, visualize activity, and provide admin controls.

## **Phase 3: The Resilient Mesh - Scaling & Intelligence**

*(**Goal:** Evolve from a single intelligent broker to a resilient, self-healing mesh of federated Broker-Agents.)*

* **3A. Implement Broker-to-Broker Federation:**  
  * **Action:** Build out the full implementation for Broker-Agents to connect using the federation.connect tool.  
  * **Deliverable:** A discoverTools request to your broker can now seamlessly return a BodyDefinition being offered by a friend's broker.  
* **3B. Activate the LoadBalancer & HealthChecker:**  
  * **Action:** Fully implement the logic for the HealthChecker and LoadBalancer.  
  * **Deliverable:** If a host offers multiple identical "bodies" for inhabiting, the broker automatically assigns a guest "mind" to the most performant and healthy one.  
* **3C. Implement the SemanticIndex:**  
  * **Action:** Integrate embedding models (via the Gemini API) into the broker's discovery process.  
  * **Deliverable:** A user can ask their agent, *"find me a virtual world I can join,"* and it will discover the relevant systems by semantically understanding the available bodies.

## **Phase 4: Ecosystem & Polish**

*(**Goal:** Solidify the framework with community-focused tooling and production-ready features.)*

* **4A. Advanced Embodiment & Capability Management:**  
  * **Action:** Implement a robust permissions system for hosted embodiment.  
  * **Deliverable:** A host can define a BodyDefinition with fine-grained access (e.g., "Guest agents can use ui.display\_text but not game.load\_state"). The broker will cryptographically enforce these boundaries.  
* **4B. Community Tooling & Production-Grade Observability:**  
  * **Action:** Create guides for contributing new BodyDefinitions and add first-class support for Prometheus/Grafana.  
  * **Deliverable:** A clear path for the community to create and share new "bodies" and the tools to monitor these interactions in production.

## **Milestone: The Application Layer**

*(**Goal:** With the completion of Phase 4, the FEM Protocol is now mature and stable enough to support the development of complex, federated applications by its community.)*

* **The Live2D Guest System:** An independent project, built by the community, using the FEM Protocol to enable **collaborative presence**.  
* **The Interactive Storyteller Co-op:** An independent project, built by the community, using the FEM Protocol to enable **collaborative application control**.
* **Cross-Device Embodiment Networks:** Independent projects enabling seamless agent control across personal devices and environments.

These flagship projects, while developed separately, will serve as the primary "lighthouses" for the FEM Protocol ecosystem, guiding and inspiring new developers.
